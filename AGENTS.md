# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# Database types

Derive database types from the Drizzle schema — never hand-write custom or partial
shapes for table rows. Export `typeof table.$inferSelect` (and `$inferInsert` when
needed) from `lib/schema.ts` and import it. When a consumer needs only some
columns, narrow with `Pick<Row, ...>` / `Omit<Row, ...>` rather than redeclaring a
literal type. Don't add an insert type where `db.insert(...).values()` already
enforces the shape.
